# Pizzatory
This is Pizzatory. It was a group project from my senior year of college. I probably won't make many changes or additions though, mostly I'm posting this on GitHub as part of a portfolio.

## Getting Started
- Default admin info; user: "IB", password: "pizza"
- Click "User Settings" to add/remove admins/users
- Click "Back" to return to the login screen or "Login" to login to the main system as the user you're currently logged in to the User Settings as.
- The program feels pretty self-explanatory to me, but that's likely because I made it! For a detailed guide see documentation/User Manual.pdf

## Portfolio Information
As I've said, this was a group project from my senior year of college. It was for a Software Engineering class. As such we had to specify the program with Use Cases according to a "client's" requests (half of the group were clients and the other half developers during the requirements elicitation phase, we switched side a few times to make sure everyone had a chance at being each role).

Most of the work I did was for the "products" portion, which is the products package, the use cases referring to products, etc. Of course, there were snippets here and there I did but the majority of my work was there. I also wrote the manual for the program.

All of the files in documentation/ are my own work as of now. That is why all of the use cases are not present. I may add the other members' use cases eventually. In case I forget to update the readme, the ones I did were 9, 10, and 11 and are in Use Cases.pdf.

The files UC#_Diagram_01.pdf are sequence diagrams that show the flow of events for use cases. Some of the method names were likely changed in the final implementation.
